    "# Introduction\n",
    "To reduce bias in our estimate of the effect of the causal variable (`foundfam_owned`) on the outcome variable (`management`), we want to condition on (i.e. include in a regression model) all variables that might be a \"common cause\" of both the causal variable (`foundfam_owned`) and the outcome variable (`management`). These types of variables are named \"confounders\" or \"confounding variables\". In this notebook, we will present arguments for including confounding variables and will perform any preprocessing required to include them.\n",
